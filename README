# File Forest

File Forest is a C++ application that visualizes the file system in a user-friendly manner. This is my first major project in C++, and it serves primarily as a learning endeavor. As such, while it aims to provide useful functionality, it may not be as reliable or robust as a full-fledged application.

The program provides an interactive interface to navigate through directories and files, displaying their sizes in a human-readable format. It's a great way to visually explore your file system and understand where your disk space is being used.

## Features

- Visualize file system in a tree-like structure
- Navigate through directories and files interactively
- Display file and directory sizes in a human-readable format
- Refresh directory sizes with a single click

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++20 support
- GLFW library
